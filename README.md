This is a straightforward implementation of AVC in Python.

It is intended for prototyping and is far from a functional AVC implementation.

# TODO

- [ ] Add support for perceptual metrics such as MS-SSIM, LPIPS, and BRISQUE
- [ ] Decouple AVC and Q-AVC code totally
- [ ] Add Chroma support
- [ ] Add 8x8 transforms
- [ ] Add comments so that it is easier to interpret
